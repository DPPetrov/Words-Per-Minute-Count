# Words-Per-Minute-Count
### Console - based program, calculating the words typed per minute.
# How it works
### The words are hard-coded in an array of strings. Words are generated randomly using their index, so some words appear several times.
### The display word count is the gross word count.
# To improve
### @ Make input case-sensitive
### @ Include error correction in order to create net word count
### @ Adjust word count algorythm to match net word count
